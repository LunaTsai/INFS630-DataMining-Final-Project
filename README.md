# Crime occurrences prediction using Decision Tree
This is a group project for the INFS630 Data Mining course. My contribution involved leveraging a **Decision Tree model** to predict crime occurrences in the Chicago area, aiding police officers in enhancing their crime prevention strategies.

# What I have learned
1. Data Processing:
Be able to utilize **pandas** for data manipulation, including reading a CSV file into a DataFrame, and handling categorical data through **OneHotEncoder** for encoding categorical variables.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Be able to convert numerical values to string type, one-hot encode categorical variables, and integrate them into the DataFrame.

3. Model Training:
Be able to create and train a **Decision Tree Classifier** using **sklearn**, including **splitting the dataset** into training and test sets, and **tuning model parameters** like max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf.

4. Model Evaluation:
Be able to evaluate the model's performance using accuracy_score to determine the classifier's accuracy on the test set.

5. Visualization:
Be able to **visualize the decision tree structure** using **export_graphviz** and **pydotplus** to identify the important features and understand the model's decision-making process.
